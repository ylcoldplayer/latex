	\section*{Introduction}
	
	Digital advertising has undergone a remarkable transformation since its inception, evolving from simple banner ads to sophisticated programmatic systems powered by real-time data. At the heart of this evolution is Real-Time Bidding (RTB), an innovation that has revolutionized the way advertisers and publishers interact. RTB operates alongside key players such as Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs), Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs), and major in-house bidding systems like Google Ads and Facebook Ads Manager. This chapter explores the history of digital advertising, with a particular focus on the rise of RTB and its integration into a broader programmatic ecosystem.
	
	\section*{The Early Days of Digital Advertising}
	The first era of digital advertising began in the mid-1990s with the advent of the internet. Banner ads, such as the iconic AT\&T ad on HotWired in 1994, marked the start of online monetization. During this period, advertisers purchased ad space directly from publishers, with little data available to inform decisions. 
	As internet adoption grew, ad networks emerged to connect advertisers with publishers more efficiently. These networks aggregated inventory but lacked sophisticated targeting capabilities, leading to inefficiencies and limited personalization.
	
	\section*{The Rise of Programmatic Advertising}
	
	The introduction of programmatic advertising in the early 2000s addressed many of the shortcomings of traditional models. Automated systems began replacing manual negotiations, enabling advertisers to target audiences based on demographic, geographic, and behavioral data. This innovation paved the way for the creation of DSPs and SSPs.
	
	\subsection*{Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs)}
	
	DSPs provide advertisers with a centralized platform to manage and optimize ad campaigns across multiple channels. By leveraging advanced algorithms and real-time data, DSPs empower advertisers to bid on impressions that align with their target audience and campaign objectives.
	
	\subsection*{Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs)}
	
	On the publisher side, SSPs enable efficient management of ad inventory. SSPs connect publishers to multiple ad exchanges and DSPs, ensuring maximum revenue through competitive bidding. Together, DSPs and SSPs form the backbone of the programmatic advertising ecosystem.
	
	\section*{The Advent of Real-Time Bidding (RTB)}
	
	RTB emerged in 2009 as a game-changer in programmatic advertising. Unlike earlier methods that involved bulk purchasing of ad space, RTB allows advertisers to bid on individual impressions in real time. Key milestones in RTB history include:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{2009:} Launch of DoubleClick Ad Exchange by Google, introducing the first large-scale RTB platform.
		\item \textbf{2011:} Facebook introduced its ad exchange (FBX), extending RTB capabilities to social media advertising.
		\item \textbf{2013:} Mobile RTB gained prominence, reflecting the rapid growth of mobile internet usage.
		\item \textbf{2015:} Header bidding strategies allowed publishers to maximize revenue by offering inventory to multiple exchanges simultaneously.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section*{In-House Real-Time Bidding Systems}
	
	Major platforms like Google and Facebook have developed their own proprietary bidding systems to capitalize on their vast user bases and data resources:
	
	\subsection*{Google Ads}
	
	Google Ads integrates RTB capabilities into its ecosystem, allowing advertisers to bid on search, display, and video ads. Its advanced targeting and optimization features make it a dominant force in digital advertising.
	
	\subsection*{Facebook Ads Manager}
	
	Facebook introduced FBX to integrate RTB into its platform. Although FBX was later retired, Facebook Ads Manager continues to provide advertisers with precise audience targeting and real-time campaign optimization.
	
	\section*{Challenges and Innovations in Digital Advertising}
	
	While digital advertising has achieved remarkable success, it faces ongoing challenges such as data privacy concerns, ad fraud, and transparency issues. Regulations like GDPR and CCPA have reshaped the industry, emphasizing the need for responsible data usage. Simultaneously, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain are driving innovation, addressing these challenges, and enhancing efficiency.
	
	\section*{Conclusion}
	
	The history of digital advertising reflects a journey of continuous innovation, from static banners to dynamic, data-driven systems like RTB. Understanding this evolution highlights the transformative impact of programmatic technologies and the importance of platforms like DSPs, SSPs, and in-house solutions from tech giants like Google and Facebook. As digital advertising continues to evolve, RTB remains a cornerstone, shaping the future of how brands connect with audiences.
